I have noticed certain patterns in my productivity. Not everything equally distributed when it comes to focus and consistency. Reading a book, for example, is much different than coding for an hour; it is much different than designing for an hour, which is much different than ideating or even daydreaming for an hour. While each of these tasks are part of an entrepreneur's journey, they are unevenly perceived when it comes to actionability.

Our propensity to do something is based on how we react to it psychologically. Simple tasks will naturally get done earlier. They are less threatening, easily manageable, perhaps addictive, and eventually gratifying.

For example, let's say we are daydreaming an idea. To a daydreamer, this will be naturally addictive. I don't have to worry about reading pages and pages of documentation. I don't have to plan anything. There is no to-do list, bug to fix, meetings, coworkers, managers, you name it. In other words, the task of daydreaming is less threatening. In this particular case, daydreaming an idea may not be wrong initially, but abusing it in the long run can have debilitating effects on productivity.

Procrastination is a word that is thrown around a lot when describing one's routine. To be precise, your body (or mind) is never truly procrastinating. It's always productive on the wrong task. Put another way, you chose the wrong task to be productive on, and presumably, you most likely chose to be productive on a task that feels easier. This could include social media, or binge watching shows instead you could've picked up a book or followed along a video course lecture.
